# Job Declarator Client

The **Job Declarator Client (JDC)** is responsible for:

* Connecting to the **Pool** and **JD Server**.
* Connecting to the **Template Provider**.
* Receiving custom block templates from the Template Provider and declaring them to the pool via the **Job Declaration Protocol**.
* Sending jobs to downstream clients.
* Forwarding shares to the pool.

## Architecture Overview

The JDC sits between **SV2 downstream clients** (e.g., SV2 mining devices or Translator Proxies) and **SV2 upstream servers** (the Pool and JD Server).

* It obtains templates from the Bitcoin node.
* It creates and broadcasts jobs to downstream clients.
* It declares and sets custom jobs to the pool side.
* It also supports solo mining mode in case no upstream is available or the upstream is fraudulent

Note: while JDC can cater for multiple downstream clients, with either one or multiple channels per client, it only opens one single extended channel with the upstream Pool server.

It can receive templates from two potential sources:
- Sv2 Template Provider: a separate Sv2 application running either locally or on a different machine, for which a (optionally encrypted) TCP connection will be established
- Bitcoin Core v30+: an officially released Bitcoin Core node running locally, on the same machine, for which a UNIX socket connection will be established

```
## Setup

### Configuration File

The configuration file contains the following information:

1. The downstream socket information, which includes the listening IP address (`downstream_address`) and port (`downstream_port`).
2. The maximum and minimum protocol versions (`max_supported_version` and `min_supported_version`) with size as (`min_extranonce2_size`)
3. The authentication keys used for the downstream connections (`authority_public_key`, `authority_secret_key`)
4. The `template_provider_type` section, which determines how the pool obtains block templates. There are two options:
   - `[template_provider_type.Sv2Tp]` - Connects to an SV2 Template Provider, with the following parameters:
     - `address` - The Template Provider's network address
     - `public_key` - (Optional) The TP's authority public key for connection verification
   - `[template_provider_type.BitcoinCoreIpc]` - Connects directly to Bitcoin Core via IPC, with the following parameters:
     - `unix_socket_path` - Path to the Bitcoin Core IPC UNIX socket
     - `fee_threshold` - Minimum fee threshold to trigger new templates

For connections with a Sv2 Template Provider, you may want to verify that your TP connection is authentic. You can get the `public_key` from the logs of your TP, for example:

```
# 2024-02-13T14:59:24Z Template Provider authority key: EguTM8URcZDQVeEBsM4B5vg9weqEUnufA8pm85fG4bZd
```

### Run

There are four example configuration files found in `pool-apps/jd-client/config-examples`/:

1. `jdc-config-hosted-infra-example.toml` - Connects to a community hosted infra (Pool + JDS + Sv2 TP)
2. `jdc-config-local-infra-example.toml` - Connects to a local infra (Pool + JDS + Sv2 TP)
3. `jdc-config-bitcoin-core-ipc-hosted-infra-example.toml` - Connects to a local Bitcoin Core via IPC, and a community hosted infra (Pool + JDS)
4. `jdc-config-bitcoin-core-ipc-local-infra-example.toml` - Connects to a local Bitcoin Core via IPC, and a local infra (Pool + JDS)

Run JDC (example using hosted infra):
```bash
cd miner-apps/jd-client
cargo run -- -c config-examples/jdc-config-bitcoin-core-ipc-hosted-infra-example.toml
```

## Architecture Details

### **Component Overview**

1. **Channel Manager**: Orchestrates message routing among sub-systems in JDC
2. **Task Manager**: Manages async task lifecycle and coordination
3. **Status System**: Provides real-time monitoring and health reporting

## Internal Architecture

JDC is built from several modules that divide responsibility for handling different roles and protocols:

### **Modules**

1. **Upstream**

   * Connects to the **pool**.
   * Handles messages coming from the Pool  (the ones defined in the Common Protocol are directly handled, others are forwarded to the Channel Manager).

2. **Downstream**

   * Accepts connections from Sv2 Mining Devices or Translator Proxies.
   * Includes a **ChannelState**, which provisions new channels when `OpenStandard/ExtendedChannel` messages arrive from the downstreams.

3. **Template Receiver**

   * Connects to the **Template Provider**.
   * Handles messages received by the TP (the ones defined in the Common Protocol are directly handled, while the others are forwarded to the Channel Manager).

4. **Job Declarator**

   * Connects to the **Job Declarator Server (JDS)**.
   * Handles messages received by the JDS (the ones defined in the Common Protocol are directly handled, while the others are forwarded to the Channel Manager).

5. **Channel Manager (Orchestrator)**

   * Central coordination point.
   * Responsibilities:

     * Handles **non-common messages** forwarded from all modules.
     * Maintains **upstream channel state**.
     * Maintains most of the **Job Declarator state**.
     * Orchestrates job lifecycle and state synchronization across upstream and downstream roles.
