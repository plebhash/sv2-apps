# SV1 to SV2 Translator Proxy

A proxy that translates between Stratum V1 (SV1) and Stratum V2 (SV2) mining protocols. This translator enables SV1 mining devices to connect to SV2 pools and infrastructure, bridging the gap between legacy mining hardware and modern mining protocols.

## Architecture Overview

The translator sits between SV1 downstream roles (mining devices) and SV2 upstream roles (pool servers or proxies), providing seamless protocol translation and advanced features like channel aggregation and failover.

```

## Configuration

### Configuration File Structure

The translator uses TOML configuration files with the following structure:

```toml
# Downstream SV1 Connection (where miners connect)
downstream_address = "0.0.0.0"
downstream_port = 34255

# Protocol Version Support
max_supported_version = 2
min_supported_version = 2

# Extranonce Configuration
downstream_extranonce2_size = 4  # Min: 2, Max: 16 (CGminer max: 8)

# User Identity (appended with counter for each miner unless it starts with `sri/`)
user_identity = "your_username_here"

# Payout verification is opt-in. Keep false for standard pool mining,
# including pools that use a Bitcoin address as the username.
verify_payout = false

# Channel Configuration
aggregate_channels = true  # true: shared channel, false: individual channels

# Downstream Difficulty Configuration
[downstream_difficulty_config]
min_individual_miner_hashrate = 10_000_000_000_000.0  # 10 TH/s
shares_per_minute = 6.0
enable_vardiff = true  # Set to false when using with Job Declarator Client (JDC)

# Upstream SV2 Connections (supports multiple with failover)
[[upstreams]]
address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 34254
authority_pubkey = "9auqWEzQDVyd2oe1JVGFLMLHZtCo2FFqZwtKA5gd9xbuEu7PH72"

[[upstreams]]
address = "backup.pool.com"
port = 34254
authority_pubkey = "9auqWEzQDVyd2oe1JVGFLMLHZtCo2FFqZwtKA5gd9xbuEu7PH72"
```

### Configuration Parameters

Make sure the machine running the Translator Proxy has its clock synced with an NTP server. Certificate validation is time-sensitive, and even a small drift of a few seconds can trigger an `InvalidCertificate` error.

#### **Downstream Configuration**
- `downstream_address`: IP address for SV1 miners to connect to
- `downstream_port`: Port for SV1 miners to connect to

#### **Protocol Configuration**
- `max_supported_version`/`min_supported_version`: SV2 protocol version support
- `min_extranonce2_size`: Minimum extranonce2 size (affects mining efficiency)

#### **Channel Configuration**
- `aggregate_channels`: 
  - `true`: All miners share one upstream extended channel (more efficient)
  - `false`: Each miner gets its own upstream extended channel (more isolated)
- `user_identity`: Username for pool authentication (auto-suffixed per miner)
- `verify_payout`: When `true`, verify upstream coinbase payouts against a payout address encoded
  by `user_identity`. Keep `false` for standard pool mining, including pools that use a Bitcoin
  address as the username.

#### **Solo/Donation Payout Verification**
Payout verification is disabled by default. Set `verify_payout = true` for solo mining or
donation configurations where `user_identity` intentionally encodes an on-chain payout address:

- `sri/solo/<payout_address>/<worker>`: tProxy verifies every upstream extended job pays 100% of spendable coinbase outputs to `<payout_address>`
- `<payout_address>[.worker]`: legacy solo mode, verified as 100% miner payout when `verify_payout = true`
- `sri/donate/<pool_percentage>/<payout_address>/<worker>`: tProxy verifies the miner address receives the remaining percentage
- `sri/donate/<worker>`: full donation mode; keep `verify_payout = false` because no miner payout address is present

If verification fails, tProxy triggers upstream fallback instead of forwarding the job to SV1 miners.

#### **Difficulty Configuration**
- `min_individual_miner_hashrate`: Expected hashrate of weakest miner (in H/s)
- `shares_per_minute`: Target share submission rate
- `enable_vardiff`: Enable/disable variable difficulty adjustment (set to false when using with JDC)
  - When `true`: Translator manages difficulty adjustments based on share submission rates
  - When `false`: Upstream manages difficulty, translator forwards SetTarget messages to miners

#### **Upstream Configuration**
- `address`/`port`: SV2 upstream server connection details
- `authority_pubkey`: Public key for SV2 connection authentication

downstream_port = 34255
user_identity = "miner_farm_1"
verify_payout = false
aggregate_channels = true

[downstream_difficulty_config]

```toml
downstream_address = "0.0.0.0"
downstream_port = 34255
user_identity = "production_farm"
verify_payout = false
aggregate_channels = true

[downstream_difficulty_config]
min_individual_miner_hashrate = 50_000_000_000_000.0  # 50 TH/s
shares_per_minute = 10.0
enable_vardiff = true

# Primary upstream
[[upstreams]]
address = "primary.pool.com"
port = 34254

## Architecture Details

### **Component Overview**

1. **SV1 Server**: Handles incoming SV1 connections from mining devices
2. **SV2 Upstream**: Manages connections to SV2 pool servers with failover
3. **Channel Manager**: Orchestrates message routing and protocol translation
4. **Task Manager**: Manages async task lifecycle and coordination
5. **Status System**: Provides real-time monitoring and health reporting

### **Channel Modes**

- **Aggregated Mode**: All miners share one  extended channel
  - More efficient for large farms
  - Reduced upstream connection overhead
  - Shared work distribution

- **Non-Aggregated Mode**: Each miner gets individual upstream channel
  - Better isolation between miners
  - Individual difficulty adjustment by the upstream Pool
